# Machine_Learning
Welcome to my Machine Learning Notebooks repository! This collection houses my initial forays into the exciting world of machine learning. As I embark on this learning journey, I've documented my progress and experiments in the form of Jupyter notebooks, all of which you'll find in this repository.

In this repository, you'll discover a variety of notebooks covering fundamental concepts, algorithms, and applications in the field of machine learning. These notebooks are aimed at beginners, and I hope they serve as a helpful resource for those who are just starting to explore the vast landscape of machine learning.

Here's a brief overview of the contents you can expect to find in this repository:

Introduction to Machine Learning: A beginner-friendly introduction to the core concepts and principles of machine learning.

Supervised Learning: Notebooks covering basic supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.

Unsupervised Learning: Explorations into unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Deep Learning: An introduction to neural networks and deep learning, with hands-on examples using popular frameworks.

Projects: Practical projects that apply machine learning concepts to real-world scenarios, providing a hands-on understanding of the technology.
